# C template for Amiga intros

To use with the VBCC compiler (see my [installation script](https://github.com/nicolasbauw/Amiga-cc)). Provides startup and system restore code, copperlist setup, and also module replay¹ and VBL interrupts as features you can activate or not.

For kickstart 1.3, replace +aos68km with +kick13m in the makefile.

Compiled with module replay and VBL features, the executable weighs 1440 bytes.

## Notes
¹ Use [PTReplay v7 library](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=82170) by Mattias Karlsson Andreas Pålsson and StingRay.
